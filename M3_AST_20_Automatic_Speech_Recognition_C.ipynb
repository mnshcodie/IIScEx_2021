The Librispeech dataset is SLR12 which is the audio recording of reading English speech. The file format of data is in the form of FLAC(Free Lossless Audio Codec) without any loss in quality or loss of any original audio data.\n",

        "The audio is in English. There are two configurations: `clean` and `other`. The speakers in the corpus were ranked according to the WER (Word Error Rate) of the transcripts of a model trained on a different dataset, and were divided roughly in the middle, with the lower-WER speakers designated as \"clean\" and the higher WER speakers designated as \"other\".\n",

        "The **Common Voice Corpus** is Mozilla’s initiative to create a free database for speech recognition software. The project is supported by volunteers who record sample sentences with a microphone and review recordings of other users. The website clearly informs the volunteers of the purpose of recordings. The text is derived from different open-source text sources, including user-submitted blog posts, old books, movies and other public speech corpora. As of May 2021, the dataset contains 7.3k hours of transcribed and validated speech in 60 languages. Common Voice is challenging due to significant accented speech, hesitations, presence of foreign words, noise, reverberation, and other recording artifacts. it's in the format of .mp3\n",
